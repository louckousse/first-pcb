# FLATBRAIN
My first PCB, inspired by the Kyria from [Splitkb](https://splitkb.com) and the [Atreus](https://github.com/technomancy/atreus).
The goal is to get an unsplitted Kyria easily transportable.
The angle is 28Â° which approximatively correspond to my hand angle.

All the pcb files are created in Kicad, you can find everything in the pcb folder.

All the dxf files are created in Freecad, you can find everything in the case folder.
For now there is only file necessary to create pcb plate, and the kicad project associated.
